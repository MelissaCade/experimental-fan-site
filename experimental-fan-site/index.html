        I've been designing shirts for my family and friends for several years.
        I use the
        <a href="https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/software"
          >Silhouette Studio software</a
        >
        to create designs, the
        <a href="https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/cameo"
          >Silhouette Cameo 4</a
        >
        to cut out vinyl, and a heat press to attach the vinyl to the shirts.
        Most of my designs are created from elements found online, but some are
        original designs that I created myself. I also occasionally make
        merchandise items for a local store owner. My favorite original design
        so far is my "Bookwyrm" design, and it has become a logo for myself and
        my work, as well as many shirts for my husband and kids!

        My "Buy Books" shirts are generally made with glow-in-the-dark vinyl,
        and are quite popular with all the readers in the family. The whale and
        Milliways shirts are from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series,
        and my Ornithology, Tress, and Yumi shirts are from various books
        written by Brandon Sanderson. The Pern shirt is an homage to Anne
        McCaffrey's Dragonrider books.

        The Good Omens shirt has Aziraphale and Crowley making up a yin-yang,
        and was created after we watched the first season. "Don't piss me off,
        Art" is from Christmas Vacation and was a special design for my
        brother-in-law. The Tad Cooper shirts are a reference to the amazing
        (and gone far too soon) show Galavant.

        My kids and their friends became obsessed with chess several years ago,
        especially my younger son. They also love llamas, so I made them these
        "Chess is Llamazing" shirts. I also made a chess logo for my younger son
        to wear when he played in tournaments.

        One of my "bonus" kids is obsessed with dragons, so I have made A LOT of
        dragon shirts. Some of these shirts are made with my favorite vinyl,
        which looks black under normal lighting but then shines in a rainbow
        when seen under a strong light such as a camera flash. My kids and some
        of their friends also love dragons, so these designs get used often.

        I designed a personal crest for a friend of mine, which has ended up on
        shirts and a snowboard. I also made a "Diversified Portfolio" shirt for
        my husband who loves playing guitar and bass. I designed some "Max"
        shirts featuring our favorite dog (named Max, of course!) I've also made
        many shirts for my mom with all the names of her grandchildren, and a
        few for my dad as well. I designed a "Get Lit" bag for a local business
        as prizes for a literature-based trivia night, and a board to collect
        socks that come out of the laundry without their mates.
